**_Note:_** this is not intended to be biased in any way, towards atheism, agnosticism or faith. I simply list articles I've come across that have helped me to see different perspectives and arguments, and that I hope will assist others. If the links tend to favour an atheist viewpoint, it's because I come from a faith background, however all viewpoints are welcome. Please respect this.
