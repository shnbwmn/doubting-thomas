**_Note:_** this is not intended to be biased towards atheism, agnosticism or faith. I simply list links I've come across that have helped me to see different perspectives and arguments, and that I hope will assist others. If the links tend to favour an atheistic/agnostic viewpoint, it's because I come from a faith background, however all viewpoints are welcome. Please respect this and other users.
